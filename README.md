## Lokal-AI Backend

**Lokal-AI backend:** This is a `NestJS` based application written using `prisma` to create a local ai gpt application free of cost.
While this is totally configurable and can be extended in future to any level to have a complete AI service provider applications.

**Core Architecture**

1.  **Ollama Backend:** This is the Ollama service itself, running independently. It's responsible for managing and serving the LLMs.
2.  **Your Application Backend (API Layer):** This is the core of your application. It handles user requests, model configuration, chat session management, agent orchestration, and interacts with the Ollama backend. This will likely be a RESTful API built using a framework like Python (Flask, FastAPI), Node.js (Express), or Go.
3.  **Frontend (UI):** This is the user interface where users interact with your service. It handles user input, displays chat conversations, allows model configuration, and shows real-time streaming. This will typically be built using a framework like React, Angular, Vue.js, or Svelte.

**Entities (Data Models)**

These are the key data structures you'll need:

- **User:**

  - `user_id` (Integer, Primary Key): Unique identifier for the user.

**API Endpoints**

Here's a suggested set of API endpoints for your backend. I'm using RESTful conventions here:

- **Authentication:**

  - `POST /register`: Create a new user account.
  - `POST /login`: Authenticate a user and return an authentication token (JWT or similar) or API key.
  - `POST /logout`: Invalidate the user's session.
  - `GET /me`: Get current user details.

- **LLM Model Configurations:**

  - `GET /configs`: List all LLM model configurations for the current user.
  - `POST /configs`: Create a new LLM model configuration.
  - `GET /configs/{config_id}`: Get a specific LLM model configuration.
  - `PUT /configs/{config_id}`: Update an existing LLM model configuration.
  - `DELETE /configs/{config_id}`: Delete an LLM model configuration.

- **Chat Sessions:**

  - `GET /sessions`: List all chat sessions for the current user.
  - `POST /sessions`: Create a new chat session. The request body should include the `config_id` of the LLM model configuration to use.
  - `GET /sessions/{session_id}`: Get a specific chat session (including metadata).
  - `PUT /sessions/{session_id}`: Update an existing chat session.
  - `DELETE /sessions/{session_id}`: Delete a chat session.

- **Chat Messages:**

  - `GET /sessions/{session_id}/messages`: Retrieve chat history for a specific session (with pagination). Consider query parameters like `limit` and `offset` for pagination.
  - `POST /sessions/{session_id}/messages`: Send a new message to the chat session. This is the core endpoint for interacting with the LLM. The request body should include the `content` (user's message). The backend will then:
    1.  Retrieve the associated LLM model configuration.
    2.  Send the conversation history (and the new message) to Ollama.
    3.  Receive the LLM's response from Ollama.
    4.  Store the new message (user's message and LLM's response) in the database.
    5.  Stream the response back to the user.
  - `GET /messages/{message_id}`: Get a specific message.
  - `DELETE /messages/{message_id}`: Delete a specific message.

- **Ollama Model Management (Optional - for advanced users/admin):**

  - `GET /models`: List available models in Ollama. (This requires interacting with the Ollama API).
  - `POST /models/{model_name}`: Pull a model from Ollama (if it's not already present).
  - `DELETE /models/{model_name}`: Remove a model from Ollama.

- **Agents (If implementing agent-based chat):**
  - `GET /agents`: List available agents for the current user.
  - `POST /agents`: Create a new agent.
  - `GET /agents/{agent_id}`: Get a specific agent.
  - `PUT /agents/{agent_id}`: Update an existing agent.
  - `DELETE /agents/{agent_id}`: Delete an agent.
  - `GET /tools`: List available tools.

**Real-time Streaming**

This is crucial for a good user experience. Here's how to handle it:

1.  **Server-Sent Events (SSE):** This is a simple and effective way to stream data from the backend to the frontend. The server pushes updates to the client over a single HTTP connection. This is well-supported by most browsers and backend frameworks.
2.  **WebSockets:** WebSockets provide full-duplex communication. They are more complex to implement than SSE but offer more flexibility. If you need two-way real-time communication (e.g., the ability for the client to interrupt the LLM), WebSockets might be a better choice.

- **Endpoint for Streaming:** The `POST /sessions/{session_id}/messages` endpoint should be responsible for streaming the LLM's response. Instead of returning a single JSON response, it should:
  1.  Establish an SSE or WebSocket connection with the client.
  2.  As the LLM generates tokens, send each token (or small chunks of tokens) as an SSE event or WebSocket message.
  3.  When the LLM finishes generating the response, send a special "end-of-stream" event or message to signal completion.

**Agent-Based Chat Considerations**

- **Agent Orchestration:** You'll need a mechanism to orchestrate the agents. This involves:

  - Analyzing the user's input.
  - Determining which agent(s) are relevant.
  - Passing the input to the selected agent(s).
  - Collecting the results from the agents.
  - Composing a final response to the user.

- **Tool Integration:** Agents often use tools to perform specific tasks (e.g., searching the web, accessing a database, running code). You'll need to define a standard interface for agents to interact with these tools.

- **Reasoning and Planning:** More advanced agents can reason about the user's goals and plan a sequence of actions to achieve those goals. This often involves using a "planner" component that leverages the LLM itself.

**Important Features and Considerations**

- **Security:**
  - **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. Use API keys and JWT.
  - **Input Validation:** Sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks.
  - **Rate Limiting:** Protect your API from abuse by implementing rate limiting.
- **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling to gracefully handle unexpected situations. Return informative error messages to the client.
- **Scalability:** Consider how your application will scale as the number of users and requests increases. Use load balancing, caching, and database optimization techniques.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement monitoring and logging to track the performance of your application and identify potential problems.
- **Ollama Integration:**
  - **Model Management:** Provide a way for users to select which Ollama models to use.
  - **Parameter Tuning:** Allow users to fine-tune the parameters of the LLM (e.g., temperature, top_p).
  - **Error Handling:** Handle errors from the Ollama service gracefully.
- **User Interface (UI) Design:**
  - **Intuitive Chat Interface:** Create a clean and easy-to-use chat interface.
  - **Clear Model Configuration:** Provide a clear and understandable way for users to configure LLM models.
  - **Real-time Feedback:** Provide real-time feedback to the user as the LLM generates its response.
- **Database Choice:** Choose a suitable database to store your entities. PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB are common choices.
- **API Documentation:** Use a tool like Swagger/OpenAPI to document your API.

**Example Workflow (Sending a Message)**

1.  **User Input:** User types a message into the chat UI and sends it.
2.  **Frontend Request:** The frontend sends a POST request to `/sessions/{session_id}/messages` with the user's message in the request body.
3.  **Backend Processing:**
    - The backend authenticates the user.
    - It retrieves the `ChatSession` and its associated `LLMModelConfig` based on the `session_id`.
    - It retrieves the chat history (`ChatMessage` objects) for the session.
    - It constructs a prompt for Ollama, including the system prompt from the `LLMModelConfig`, the chat history, and the user's new message.
4.  **Ollama Request:** The backend sends a request to the Ollama API to generate a response.
5.  **Ollama Response (Streaming):** Ollama starts streaming the response back to the backend.
6.  **Backend Streaming to Frontend:** The backend receives the streamed response from Ollama and forwards it to the frontend using SSE or WebSockets.
7.  **Frontend Display:** The frontend receives the streamed response and displays it to the user in real-time.
8.  **Data Persistence:** Once the LLM has finished generating the response, the backend stores both the user's message and the LLM's response as new `ChatMessage` objects in the database.

**Key Improvements & Considerations (Addressing Potential Shortcomings)**

- **Prompt Engineering & Context Management:** The prompt you send to Ollama is _critical_. You need to carefully manage the context window of the LLM. If the chat history is too long, you'll exceed the context limit. Strategies for dealing with this include:
  - **Summarization:** Periodically summarize the chat history to reduce its size.
  - **Truncation:** Truncate the chat history to a fixed number of recent messages.
  - **Vector Databases (Embedding Search):** Store chat history as embeddings in a vector database. Retrieve relevant chunks of history based on semantic similarity to the current user query. This is a more advanced approach but can significantly improve performance.
- **Rate Limiting:** Absolutely essential to prevent abuse and protect your Ollama instance. Implement rate limiting per user/API key.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Use asynchronous programming (async/await in Python, Promises in JavaScript) to handle the I/O-bound operations of interacting with Ollama and the database. This will improve the responsiveness of your application.
- **Caching:** Cache frequently accessed data (e.g., LLM model configurations) to reduce database load.
- **Deployment:** Consider how you will deploy your application. Docker is a good choice for containerizing your application and its dependencies. You can then deploy it to a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. Also consider Docker Compose for local development with Ollama.
- **Testing:** Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the quality of your code.
- **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring to track the performance of your application and identify potential problems. Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
- **Ollama Updates:** Stay up-to-date with the latest versions of Ollama and update your application accordingly. Be aware of any breaking changes in the Ollama API.
- **Multi-Tenancy:** If you plan to support multiple users, you'll need to implement multi-tenancy. This involves isolating user data and resources. Make sure each user only has access to their own data and configurations.
